      Thanks for taking the time to get to know me better. I'm Steve! A budding
      web developer who's passionate about technology, especially as it pertains
      to software engineering and design.

      As a young gamer, I was quickly exposed to the hardware that powered many
      captivating experiences. My curiosity of the "HOW?!" was rampant, and
      growing up with the Internet was especially helpful in answering those
      questions. Software!
    </p>

    <p>
      While I didn't have the appreciation of how crucial mathematics played a
      role in many of these experiences, I have retroactively studied and honed
      my abilities to nurture the developer I have always dreamed of being.
    </p>

    <p>
      The more I learn, the more I discover the endless possibilities at my
      fingertips. I'm enthusiastic about the future, excited by the constant
      need to learn and adapt to new ways of achieving amazing solutions.
    </p>

    <p>I look forward to working with you!</p>
